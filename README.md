###About the Project###

This is an employee management application, as of now the side nav items have Overview (functional), Messages (unfunctional), Search (functional), Manage (Functional),History (unfunctional), My Account (Functional).

on clicking on Search you can serach from side nav - it will redirect to serach component where you can search for employee based on the name or email

on clicking on Manage you can see all employee records, edit employee records, delete employee records, add employee records

<strong>in this version v1, recently added employee records are not being stored, so original array with employee json will show up in search component, hiwever new employees details will appear in Manage component when you add employee details</strong>
